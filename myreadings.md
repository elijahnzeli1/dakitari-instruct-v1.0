## Let me explain what the @advanced_training.py script does:

Training Approach:

- Unlike finetune.py which fine-tunes a pre-trained model, advanced_training.py implements a custom training loop with specialized medical domain adaptations
- It uses a medical-aware loss function that gives extra weight to medical terms
- The model architecture remains the same size (parameters don't increase) but the weights are optimized differently

Key Components:

```python
class AdvancedTrainer:
    def supervised_training(self, train_dataset, output_dir, learning_rate=1e-5):
        # Custom medical-aware loss function
        def medical_aware_loss(y_true, y_pred):
            mask = tf.cast(y_true != -100, tf.float32)
            y_true_processed = tf.where(y_true == -100, tf.zeros_like(y_true), y_true)
            
            # Base cross-entropy loss
            ce_loss = tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(
                y_true_processed, y_pred, from_logits=False)
            
            # Additional penalty for medical terms
            medical_terms_mask = self._get_medical_terms_mask(y_true_processed) * mask
            medical_term_loss = ce_loss * medical_terms_mask * 2.0  # Double weight for medical terms
            
            return tf.reduce_sum(ce_loss + medical_term_loss) / denominator

```

## What It Does:

- Focuses on medical domain adaptation without increasing model size
- Applies stronger learning signals for medical terminology
- Uses specialized metrics for medical text generation
- Implements custom checkpointing for medical domain performance

## Why Parameters Don't Increase:

- The script optimizes existing parameters rather than adding new ones
- It's doing "in-place" specialization rather than model expansion
- The focus is on quality of medical knowledge rather than model capacity

## Limitations:

- May not capture as much medical knowledge as a larger model
- Limited by the original model architecture
- Relies heavily on the quality of medical training data

To increase model capacity and parameters, you would need to:

1. **Modify the model architecture in transformer_model.py**:

```python
class DakitariInstructModel(keras.Model):
    def __init__(
            self,
            vocab_size=30522,
            maxlen=512,
            embed_dim=768,  # Increase from 256
            num_heads=12,   # Increase from 8
            ff_dim=3072,    # Increase from 512
            num_transformer_blocks=12,  # Increase from 6
            dropout_rate=0.1
        ):
```

2. **Add more specialized medical layers**:
 ```python
 class MedicalEnhancementLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.medical_attention = MultiHeadSelfAttention(hidden_size, num_heads=8)
        self.medical_ffn = ExpertLayer(hidden_size * 4, hidden_size)
        
    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.medical_attention(inputs)
        return self.medical_ffn(x)
```
           
Would you like me to provide guidance on how to modify the model architecture to increase its capacity while maintaining the medical domain specialization?
